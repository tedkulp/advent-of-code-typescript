## \--- Part Two ---

To make things a little more interesting, the Elf introduces one additional rule. Now, `J` cards are [jokers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(playing_card)) - wildcards that can act like whatever card would make the hand the strongest type possible.

To balance this, _`J` cards are now the weakest_ individual cards, weaker even than `2`. The other cards stay in the same order: `A`, `K`, `Q`, `T`, `9`, `8`, `7`, `6`, `5`, `4`, `3`, `2`, `J`.

`J` cards can pretend to be whatever card is best for the purpose of determining hand type; for example, `QJJQ2` is now considered _four of a kind_. However, for the purpose of breaking ties between two hands of the same type, `J` is always treated as `J`, not the card it's pretending to be: `JKKK2` is weaker than `QQQQ2` because `J` is weaker than `Q`.

Now, the above example goes very differently:

    32T3K 765
    T55J5 684
    KK677 28
    KTJJT 220
    QQQJA 483
    

*   `32T3K` is still the only _one pair_; it doesn't contain any jokers, so its strength doesn't increase.
*   `KK677` is now the only _two pair_, making it the second-weakest hand.
*   `T55J5`, `KTJJT`, and `QQQJA` are now all _four of a kind_! `T55J5` gets rank 3, `QQQJA` gets rank 4, and `KTJJT` gets rank 5.

With the new joker rule, the total winnings in this example are `_5905_`.

Using the new joker rule, find the rank of every hand in your set. _What are the new total winnings?_
